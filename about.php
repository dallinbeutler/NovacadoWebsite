			   I am Dallin Beutler, a Senior at BYU-I graduating soon. I picked this up as a project for a class,
			   and it has developed into a whole new animal of it's own. I am busy with school, but I hope to keep
			   developing this in my free time. If there is enough demand and donations, I will try to work on this
			   full time when I graduate. if you would like to contact me, my email is dallinbeutler@gmail.com.
