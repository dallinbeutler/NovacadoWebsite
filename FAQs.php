			         Q. What exactly is Novacado?
					 <br/><br/>
					 A. A media player for DVD's and other video files. 
					 It has the unique ability to censor out uncomfortable visuals, audio, or entire scenes specified by the user.
					 <br/><br/><br/>
					 Q. Does it automatically censor things for me?
					 <br/><br/>
					 A. No, sadly. You must find a censor file from our handy <a class="white" href="Edits.php">online database</a> 
					 or make your own using the built in editor.
					 <br/><br/><br/>
					 Q. Does it cost any money?
					 <br/><br/>
					 A. It is completely free. In order to keep the servers and development up and running,
					 <a class="white" href="about.php">donations</a> would be greatly appreciated.
					 <br/><br/><br/>
					 Q. Can I combine Censor files?
					 <br/><br/>
					 A. Yes. Simply choose the Edits> add Edits button in the menu for every file you want
					 <br/><br/><br/>
					 Q. When is the full version coming out?
					 <br/><br/>
					 A. As soon as I feel comfortable with the product. I will try and keep those interested as informed as I can.
